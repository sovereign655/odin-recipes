    <h2>steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Prepare the Steak:</i> 
                Remove the steak from the refrigerator and let it sit at 
                room temperature for approximately 30 minutes, allowing it to 
                relax and ensuring even cooking.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Seasoning the Star:</i> 
                Gently pat the steak dry with paper towels to encourage a beautiful sear.
                Season both sides generously with coarse sea salt and freshly 
                ground black pepper, ensuring each grain of salt and speck of 
                pepper adheres to the meat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>The Pan Dance:</i> In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat a drizzle of olive 
                oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers.
                Add the seasoned steak to the pan, allowing it to sizzle enchantingly as it 
                meets the hot surface.
                Allow the steak to cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, forming a glorious 
                caramelized crust on one side.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>The Magic Flip:</i> Carefully turn the steak using a pair of tongs, 
                treating it with the utmost respect.
                Add a couple of tablespoons of unsalted butter to the pan, along 
                with the fresh thyme sprigs and crushed garlic cloves, 
                allowing the flavors to weave their way into the steak.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Infuse the Symphony:</i> 
                Baste the steak with the melted butter using a spoon, 
                ensuring every nook and cranny is touched with the herbaceous 
                and garlicky goodness.
                <b>Optional:</b> For a subtle fiery twist, sprinkle a pinch of red pepper 
                flakes over the steak.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>The Moment of Rest:</i> 
                Remove the steak from the refrigerator and let it sit at 
                room temperature for approximately 30 minutes, allowing it to 
                relax and ensuring even cooking.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>A Symphony of Aromas:</i> 
                In the same pan, sauté the finely diced shallots until they turn soft 
                and translucent, absorbing the residual flavors of the steak.
                De-glaze the pan with a splash of balsamic vinegar, scraping up any 
                delightful browned bits to create a luscious sauce.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>The Finale:</i> 
                Drizzle the tantalizing balsamic reduction over the rested steak, 
                enveloping it in a symphony of flavors.
                Adorn the steak with a sprig of fresh thyme, symbolizing the elegance and 
                simplicity of this masterpiece.
