            <p>
                <i>Preheat and Prepare:</i> 
                Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C), 
                allowing it to reach the perfect temperature to 
                create a crispy crust.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Roll and Spread:</i> 
                On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza 
                dough into your desired size and thickness, ensuring a uniform 
                canvas for our flavorful creation.
                Carefully transfer the rolled dough onto a 
                baking sheet or pizza stone lined with parchment paper, ensuring it 
                retains its shape.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Sauced and Cheesy Delight:</i> 
                Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce on the pizza dough, 
                leaving a small border around the edges for a delightful crust.
                Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over 
                the sauce, creating a luscious and creamy base for our toppings.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>The Pepperoni Dance:</i> 
                Artfully arrange the sliced pepperoni on top of the cheese, 
                ensuring every bite is adorned with the rich and savory flavor.
                Optional: For a touch of herbaceous elegance, lightly sprinkle dried 
                oregano over the pizza.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Bake to Perfection:</i> 
                Slide the prepared pizza into the preheated oven, allowing it to bake for 10-12 
                minutes or until the crust turns golden and the cheese melts into 
                a blissful sea of decadence. Remove the pizza from the oven and 
                let it rest for a moment, allowing the flavors to harmonize.
            </p>
