    <ol class="recipe-steps">
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Preheat and Prepare:</i>
                Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C),
                allowing it to reach the perfect temperature to
                create a crispy crust.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Roll and Spread:</i>
                On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza
                dough into your desired size and thickness, ensuring a uniform
                canvas for our flavorful creation.
                Carefully transfer the rolled dough onto a
                baking sheet or pizza stone lined with parchment paper, ensuring it
                retains its shape.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Sauced and Cheesy Delight:</i>
                Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce on the pizza dough,
                leaving a small border around the edges for a delightful crust.
                Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over
                the sauce, creating a luscious and creamy base for our toppings.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>The Pepperoni Dance:</i>
                Artfully arrange the sliced pepperoni on top of the cheese,
                ensuring every bite is adorned with the rich and savory flavor.
                Optional: For a touch of herbaceous elegance, lightly sprinkle dried
                oregano over the pizza.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Bake to Perfection:</i>
                Slide the prepared pizza into the preheated oven, allowing it to bake for 10-12
                minutes or until the crust turns golden and the cheese melts into
                a blissful sea of decadence. Remove the pizza from the oven and
                let it rest for a moment, allowing the flavors to harmonize.
            </p>
        </li>
        
    </ol>
